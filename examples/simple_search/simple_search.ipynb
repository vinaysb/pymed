Three levels of organizational preparedness were identified: 'early awareness and preparation'; 'unaware and not ready' and 'aware, but not ready'. Most organizations were aware of the COVID-19 severity, but not fully prepared for the pandemic, especially stand-alone enterprises that may not have sufficient resources to cope with an unanticipated crisis. The experiences shared by OSH professionals illustrate their agility in applying risk management and control skills to unanticipated public/occupational health crises that arise.\",\n",
